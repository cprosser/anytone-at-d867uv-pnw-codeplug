I have done a major update to the Anytone AT-D878UV HT Codeplug.  I have used Steve N7LNX's excellent D868UV codeplug as the basis and imported it into the 878.  From there, I've tried to touch on every digital feature that this radio supports, more especially those supported by the 878.  I used CPS: v1.10 and FW: v1.10 as it is the most current.


From there, here's the list of the additions/modifications:

    Everson/Mt Sumas Zone added (new repeater Northeast of Bellingham)
    Roaming Sampler (I-5 from Larch to Lookout on timeslot 1)
    APRS:  Analog and Digital Sampler Zone (digital only works on BM and that must be set-up in BM self-care)
    Simplex:  Analog and Digital Zone
    Custom Zone for user modifications (suggest you not modify the stock zones unless you know what you are doing)
    Public Service Talkgroups Zone (removed PS 1 and PS 2 from each individual zone)
    Net 2 Talkgroup added to all Washington Idaho repeater zones
    Zone labeling changed to City/Site and alphabetized (not everyone knows where the mountaintops are located)
    Pleasant Alert tones, replaced stock outrageously loud tones

Don't forget to change the stock Radio ID number to your own before you write to your radio.
